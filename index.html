<h2>Beginner's MATLAB Workshop for Researchers</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION
  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
 Participants enrolled in this MATLAB workshop will learn how to read 
 and visualise real (noisy, messy) data and the tools available perform 
 statistical analysis using MATLAB.
  The mission of Research Platform Services is to help researchers 
  with the research-specific IT things they do. We offer data storage, 
  cloud and high performance computing services and run workshops on the 
  latest digital research skills. Our training/workshops program has a strong 
  focus on community building (i.e. connecting researchers who use similar 
  digital research tools) and is referred to as the Research Bazaar. 
  Participants are be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

</p>

<!--
  AUDIENCE
  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  Researchers who have completed the MATLAB for Beginners course and would like to learn
  how to use Statistics toolbox on realistic datasets

  ETHERPAD
  At `_misc/etherpad.txt` you will find a template for the etherpad.
  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to
      http://etherpad.mozilla.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site
  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop (e.g.,
  '2015-06-10-esu'.

  SYLLABUS
  Show what topics will be covered.
  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.
  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<h3>Wifi</h3>

<p>
  Prior to the workshop, University of Melbourne staff/students should ensure that their 
  laptop can connect to UniWireless. Instructions on how to do this and where to get 
  assistance can be found 
  <a href="http://its.unimelb.edu.au/help/networks-access/networks-internet/connect-wireless/unimelb">here</a>.
  Attendees from other Australian universities should find out (from the IT website of
  their home institution) how to connect to the Eduroam wireless network.
</p>

<div> <!-- Start of 'editor' section. -->
  <!-- <h3>Text Editor</h3>
  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.
  </p>
  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <p>
  <code>nano</code> is the editor installed by the Software
  Carpentry Installer, it is a basic editor integrated into the
  lesson material.
      </p>
      <p>
  <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a
  popular free code editor for Windows.  Be aware that you must
  add its installation directory to your system path in order to
  launch it from the command line (or have other tools like Git
  launch it for you).  Please ask your instructor to help you do
  this.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
  We recommend
  <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a> or
  <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
  In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
  which should be pre-installed.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Linux</h4>
      <p>
  <a href="http://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a> is one option for
  Linux users.  In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>, which
  should be pre-installed.

<!--   <h3>The Bash Shell</h3>
  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.
  </p>
  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <p>
  Install Git for Windows by download and running
  <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">the installer</a>.
  This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
      </p>
      <h4>Software Carpentry Installer</h4>
      <p><em>This installer requires an active internet connection.</em></p>
      <p>After installing Python and Git Bash:</p>
      <ul>
  <li>
          Download the <a href="{{site.swc_installer}}">installer</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
          If the file opens directly in the browser
          select <strong>File&rarr;Save Page As</strong> to download it
          to your computer.
  </li>
  <li>
          Double click on the file to run it.
  </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
  The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash, so no
  need to install anything.  You access bash from the Terminal
  (found in
  <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want to keep
  Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Linux</h4>
      <p>
  The default shell is usually <code>bash</code>, but if your
  machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
  terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
  install anything.

<h3>MATLAB</h3>

<p>
  MATLAB is a very popular data analysis environment. It's a commercial product,
  however most universities provide free licences to their staff
  and students. University of Melbourne people can find instructions on
  how to install Matlab on their personal laptop
  <a href="http://github.com/resbaz/lessons/blob/master/matlab/unimelb_matlab_install.md">here</a>.
  Participants from other institutions should ask their IT department for assistance.
</p>
<p>
  The instructors at the workshop will be using Matlab 2014b. Since each new
  version has a slightly different look and feel (not to mention new functionality that isn't
  available in previous versions), it's important that participants also install this version.
</p>
